# detox-butler

This project is based on the [Test Butler](https://github.com/linkedin/test-butler) project. This 
project is implementation of the very basic functionality taken from the original Test Butler but
with support for the latest Android versions.
The original Test Butler project at this time is outdated and trying to make all of the functionality
work on all Android versions is a bit of a challenge. 

## Features
